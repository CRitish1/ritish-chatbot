Simple AI Chatbot
This Python script implements a simple chatbot named "Ritish's AI". The chatbot engages in conversation with users, responding to various queries and providing information on a range of topics.

Features
User Interaction: The chatbot prompts the user for input and responds based on predefined responses.
Predefined Responses: Responses to common greetings, inquiries, expressions of gratitude, farewells, and various questions on different topics are predefined.
Multiple Topics: The chatbot provides information on a variety of topics, including time, the chatbot's name, its purpose, and facts related to the ocean, space, history, technology, animals, sports, literature, computers, unusual facts, philosophical inquiries, humor, and secrets.
Engaging Conversations: Responses are designed to be informative, entertaining, and engaging, incorporating factual information, wit, and humor.
Error Handling: If the user input does not match any predefined responses, the chatbot displays a default message indicating that it doesn't have a response for that input.
